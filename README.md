## Prior Art

gloam is heavily based on two of my favorite colorschemes,
[tender](https://github.com/jacoborus/tender.vim) and
[Greenery](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/nova-theme). In fact, itâ€™s
essentially a palette swap of tender, using mostly the Greenery colors.
The [gloam header image](https://github.com/ngscheurich/gloam-vim) is a direct
remix of [tenderâ€™s](https://github.com/ngscheurich/gloam-vim).

Many thanks to [@jacoborus](https://github.com/jacoborus/) and
[@Jaredk3nt](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt) for their hard work!

## Installation

Simply download [gloam.itermcolors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngscheurich/gloam-iterm2/master/gloam.itermcolors)
and double-click it to import it to iTerm2. Alternatively, select the file from
iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > [some profile] > Color Presets > Import.

Hereâ€™s a shell one-liner in case youâ€™re into that sort of thing

```sh
$ cd /tmp && curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngscheurich/gloam-iterm2/master/gloam.itermcolors \
  && open gloam.itermcolors && cd -
```
